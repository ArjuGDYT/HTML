    <h1> Computer Builds </h1>
    <div class="Introduction">
    <p> I am interested in computer builds because I was always interested in building my own PC with parts and I really like watching other YouTubers on how build their PCs </p>
    <p> I just began from watching videos but I was inspired because I had to learn about it for one of my high school projects </p>
    <p> My friend inspired me because he built his own PC </p>
    <p> I just really want to build a PC so I can have my own workstation </p>
